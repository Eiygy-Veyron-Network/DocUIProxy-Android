Help applications that haven't supported Storage Access Framework (likes WeChat) 
to pick media from Android Documents UI

## What can it do?

Handle camera actions and response with media files from Android Documents UI 
when selected applications requests a photo.

## How to use?

2. Long press "Gallery" (相册/相簿) button in the bottom bar of chat pages.
3. Choose "SAF Enhancer Lite" (You can also make it as default. 
Because we allow other applications to use a real camera app when they are calling proxy camera.)

supported DocumentsProvider (like Google Photos, Google Drive, etc.)
